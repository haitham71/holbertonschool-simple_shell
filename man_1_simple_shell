.TH HSH 1 "December 30, 2025" "hsh 1.0" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
hsh \- a simple UNIX command interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ./hsh
[
.I file
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a simple command-line interpreter that reads commands from the standard input or from a file and executes them. It is designed to function as a minimalist UNIX shell.
.PP
The shell parses user input, tokenizes the commands based on whitespace, searches for the executable in the system's
.B PATH
(or uses the absolute path provided), and executes the command in a child process.
.SH INVOCATION
.B hsh
can be invoked in two modes:
.TP
.B Interactive Mode
When invoked without arguments and connected to a terminal,
.B hsh
prints the prompt
.B cisfun$
and waits for the user to type a command.
.TP
.B Non-Interactive Mode
When invoked with a
.I file
argument, or when input is piped into it,
.B hsh
reads commands from the stream line by line and executes them without printing a prompt.
.SH COMMAND SYNTAX
Commands are sequences of words separated by spaces or tabs. The first word is assumed to be the command name, and subsequent words are arguments passed to that command.
.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
The shell supports the following built-in command:
.TP
.B exit
Terminates the shell immediately. It does not currently accept arguments (exit status codes).
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.B hsh
uses the following environment variables:
.TP
.B PATH
A colon-separated list of directories. When a command is not an absolute path (e.g., does not contain '/'),
.B hsh
searches through these directories to find the executable. If
.B PATH
is unset, the shell defaults to
.I /bin:/usr/bin
.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.B hsh
returns the exit status of the last executed command.
.TP
.B 0
Success (or normal exit).
.TP
.B 1
General error (e.g., failure to open input file).
.TP
.B 127
Command not found or execution failed.
.SH EXAMPLES
.B Running interactively:
.RS
.nf
$ ./hsh
cisfun$ ls -l
total 16
-rwxr-xr-x 1 user user 8000 Dec 30 12:00 hsh
cisfun$ exit
$
.fi
.RE

.B Running a script file:
.RS
.nf

/bin/echo "Hello World"
ls
$ ./hsh commands.txt

hsh  commands.txt
.fi
.RE
.SH ERRORS

.B hsh
prints an error message to standard error in the following format:
.PP
.B ./hsh: 1: command_name: not found
